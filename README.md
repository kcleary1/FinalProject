  This program is called Asset Class Analyzer. It gives the user the ability to review investment returns of $1000 for 3 different investment indexes for a period of 1-20 years. The indexes chosen for review are US Large Growth (stocks), US Small Value (stocks), and US Total Bond. These are 3 easily accessible indexes, as there are ETFs and mutual funds tracking them available at all the major low-cost/no-cost brokers and many employer sponsored retirement plans. In addition, these three indexes are well diversified and representative of asset classes that are considered largely independent of each other in terms of return characteristics and risk. Lastly, an investment time frame of 1-20 years gives the user a practical range of timeframes to examine and use for many of the investment needs that occur throughout life.
    The use of the Asset Class Analyzer is designed to be straightforward; the user simply chooses one of the above mentioned indexes and the number of years investment returns are needed for (2 dropdown menus are present for these choices). After these selections are made the user is shown the lowest, average, and highest rolling returns for the number of years selected for the applicable index (via 3 textboxes). This information is from monthly returns for the indexes going back to 1987. The table with these returns was taken from Portfolio Visualizer.
